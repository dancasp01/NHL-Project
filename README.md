This was a fun challenge as the NHL got rid of their standard API and implemented a new, hard to use one for some reason.

My friends and I are massive hockey fans (LETS GO RANGERS!), and the Sportsnet instagram account would sometimes post a "guess the NHL player." 
They would show the players career path, starting from their first team to the team they currently play for. Unfortunately, Sportsnet does not post a lot of these and we found ourselves wanting to do more.
Voil√†, an idea is born! The code is complete and now we will begin working on the front end!
